# AgentGraphSociety Neo4j Integration Specifications

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive specifications for integrating Neo4j graph database into AgentSociety, transforming it into AgentGraphSociety - a graph-powered multi-agent social simulation framework.

## Specification Documents

### 1. [Overview](01-overview.md)
High-level overview of the Neo4j integration project, including objectives, architecture, and success metrics.

### 2. [Data Model](02-data-model.md)
Detailed Neo4j schema design including:
- Node types (Agent, Organization, Location, Message)
- Relationship types (KNOWS, FAMILY, COLLEAGUE, FRIEND, etc.)
- Indexes and constraints
- Data integrity rules

### 3. [Agent Modifications](03-agent-modifications.md)
Required changes to agent classes:
- New `GraphAgentBase` class
- Modifications to `CitizenAgentBase` and `SocietyAgent`
- Enhanced blocks for graph-aware operations
- Backward compatibility strategies

### 4. [Relationship System](04-relationship-system.md)
Enhanced relationship mechanics:
- Relationship lifecycle and evolution
- Multi-type relationships
- Influence propagation
- Community detection
- Performance optimizations

### 5. [Migration Strategy](05-migration-strategy.md)
Zero-downtime migration plan:
- Phased migration approach
- Dual-write implementation
- Data validation
- Rollback procedures
- Migration tools and scripts

### 6. [API Specifications](06-api-specifications.md)
Complete API documentation:
- Neo4j client API
- Agent operations
- Relationship operations
- Query operations
- REST endpoints

### 7. [Performance Considerations](07-performance-considerations.md)
Performance optimization strategies:
- Query optimization
- Caching architecture
- Connection pooling
- Monitoring and metrics
- Scalability considerations

### 8. [Implementation Plan](08-implementation-plan.md)
Detailed 8-week implementation timeline:
- Phase breakdowns
- Resource requirements
- Risk management
- Success criteria
- Post-launch plan

## Key Benefits

1. **Rich Relationships**: Move from simple dictionaries to multi-dimensional graph relationships
2. **Dynamic Networks**: Enable realistic social dynamics and influence propagation
3. **Scalability**: Support millions of agents with billions of relationships
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Leverage graph algorithms for insights
5. **Flexibility**: Maintain backward compatibility while enabling new features

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Overview](01-overview.md) for project understanding
2. Study the [Data Model](02-data-model.md) for schema design
3. Check [Agent Modifications](03-agent-modifications.md) for code changes
4. Follow the [Implementation Plan](08-implementation-plan.md) for execution

## Decision Points Requiring Approval

### 1. Technology Choices
- **Neo4j Version**: 5.15 with Graph Data Science plugin
- **Driver**: Official Python async driver
- **Deployment**: Docker-based for development, cluster for production

### 2. Architecture Decisions
- **Hybrid Storage**: Graph for relationships, memory for agent state
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level with Redis
- **Migration Approach**: Dual-write with gradual cutover

### 3. API Design
- **Async-First**: All operations use async/await
- **Batch Operations**: For performance at scale
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to memory system

### 4. Performance Targets
- **Query Response**: <100ms for 95th percentile
- **Scale**: 10M agents, 100M relationships
- **Throughput**: 10K operations/second

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. **Timeline**: Is the 8-week timeline acceptable?
2. **Resources**: Can we allocate the required team?
3. **Infrastructure**: Budget approval for Neo4j Enterprise?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Comfort level with gradual migration?
5. **Feature Priority**: Which enhancements to prioritize?

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** these specifications
2. **Assemble team** based on resource requirements
3. **Set up infrastructure** for development
4. **Begin Phase 1** implementation
