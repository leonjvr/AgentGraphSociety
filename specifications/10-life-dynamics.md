# Life Dynamics Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the life dynamics system for AgentGraphSociety, enabling agents to experience realistic life stages, major events, career progression, family dynamics, and long-term goal pursuit.

## Life Stage Model

### 1. Core Life Stages

```python

    """
    Major life stages with typical age ranges and characteristics.
    """

    ESTABLISHED = "established"       # 30-50
    MID_LIFE = "mid_life"            # 40-60
    PRE_RETIREMENT = "pre_retirement" # 55-65
    RETIREMENT = "retirement"         # 65+
    ELDERLY = "elderly"               # 75+
